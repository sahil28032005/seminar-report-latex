## 🔍 Algorithms Used

### 1. Smart Resource Allocation 🤖
Our IDE employs a **reinforcement learning** algorithm to dynamically allocate resources based on user demand. This ensures optimal performance while minimizing resource wastage.

### 2. Auto-Scaling 🏗️
The system automatically scales resources up or down based on current workloads, ensuring that your environment is always optimized for performance.

### 3. Security Framework 🔐
Advanced security algorithms are implemented to safeguard sensitive data, including:
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources.
